# ACE 18A 2021

## Kawasaki Disease

- Previously known as mucocutaneous lymp node syndrome
- leading cause of acquired cardiac disease in kids
- vasculitis of medium sized vessels, mainly coronaries
- coronary artery aneurysms develop in 25% of cases
- Rx with immunotherapy and anti-inflamatories (aspirin)
- classic clinical presentation:
  - high fever
  - nonexudative conjunctival redness
  - cervical lymphadenopathy
  - erythema of palms and soles
  - edema of hands and feet
  - maculopapular rash
  - strawberry tongue

## Treatment of Bronchospasm

- propofol and IA are direct bronchodilators
- B2 agonist such as albuterol

## Superior Hypogastric Plexus

- injury can lead to retrograde ejaculation and infertility
- possible with anterior approaches to the lumbosacral spine

## Pulmonary Hypertension

- any pulmonary pressure over 25mmHg
- treatment mechanisms and examples

  | Mechanism   | Example   | Adverse Effects   |
  | ----------- | --------- | ----------------- |
  | Direct relaxation of smooth muscle  | Nitric Oxide | Toxicity from production of NO2 and methemoglobin |
  | Prostocyclin receptor stimulation | Iloprost | Systemic vascular effects |
  | Prostocyclin receptor stimulation | Epoprostenol | Flushing and hypotension |
  | Calcium channel blocker | Nifedipine | Hypotension |
  | Endothelin receptor blocker | Bosentan | Liver dysfunction |
  | Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor | Sildenafil | Few
  | Angiotensin receptor blocker | Ramipril | Hypotension |

## Bayonet Effect

- Ultrasound effect that produces appearance of a bent medal needle due to the slightly different speeds with which ultrasound beams travels through muscle vs adipose tissues.

## Oculocardiac Reflex

- Afferent pathway:
  1. Long and short ciliary nerve
  2. Ciliary ganglion
  3. Opthalmic branch of trigeminal nerve (CN V)
  4. Gasserian (trigeminal) ganglion
  5. Main sensory nucleus of trigeminal nerve (in brainstem)
- Efferent pathway:
  1. Vagus nerve (CN X)
  2. Heart (release of ACh at SA node)
- Treatment:
  - stop stimulus
  - anticholinergic (glycopyrrolate or atropine)
- Makes worse:
  - hypercarbia
  - hypoxia

## Respiratory Pressure Definitions

| Pressure | Definition | Notes |
| - | - | - |
| Peak airway pressure | Maximum value of the airway pressure at airway opening | Influenced by airway resistance and lung/chest wall compliance. Increased with airway obstruction or decreased complaince issues |
| Plateau pressure | Pressure that is recorded within the airway when there is NO airflow (static compliance) | Only increases with worsening compliance. Good indicator of alveolar pressure. Obstruction has no effect (because no airflow) |
| Mean airway pressure | Average airway pressure over the total ventilatory cycle | This pressure affects heart-lung interactions

## Myocardial Ischemia Treatment

- oxygen
- aspirin
- benzodiazepine
- nitroglycerin
- Avoid:
  - Sodium nitroprusside (hypotension and reflex tachycardia)
  - Beta-blocker (leaves alpha agonism available to cause vasocoronary constriction)

## Immune System Response

- Plasma cells are differentiated B lymphcytes (B Cells) capable of secreting immunoglobulins (antibodies)
- In response to antigen exposure, T lymphocytes activate B cell to produce antibodies
- 5 types: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM
- IgM and IgG are found in blood, lymph, and tissues
- IgM comes first, followed by higher number of IgG
- On second exposure, IgG comes faster following IgM again, and it peaks higher and stay longer
- IgA found in mucous membrances and helps precent colonization
- IgE associated with allergic reactions by binding to allergens and mast cells to release histamine
- IgD rarely a/w multiple myeloma

## Hypertension Treatment in Pregnancy

- avoid ACE-I and ARB as they can cause:
  - fetal renal failure
  - oligohydramnios
  - craniofacial abnormalities
  - pulmonary hypoplasia
- treatment of choice: alpha-methyldopa
- Beta blockers may cause neonatal hypoglycemia by increasing secretion of insulin
- Mixed alpha/beta blockers (labetalol) okay
- CCB have a theoretical risk of decreasing uterine contraction and prolonging labor

## SSEP

- somatosensory-evoked potentials
- objective measure of ascending sensory pathway function
| Drug | Mechanism | Effect on SSEPs
| - | - | - |
| Ketamine | NMDA blocker (N-methyl-D-aspartate) | Increases
| Dexmedetomidine | alpha-2 agonist | Decreases
| Propofol | Enhances GABA-induced chloride current / GABA agonist | Decreases
| Xenon | NMDA blocker (N-methyl-D-aspartate) | Decreases
| Nitrous Oxide | NMDA blocker (N-methyl-D-aspartate) | Decreases

## HCM and SAM

- HCM = hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
- SAM = systolic anterior motion (of the mitral valve)
- LVOTO = left ventricular outflow tract obstruction
- Components of HCM
  1. left ventricular hypertrophy
  2. disorganized myocardial cell patterns
  3. myocardial microvascular abnormalities
  4. LVOTO
- 3 grades of HCM:
  1. Obstructive = outflow gradient > 30 mmHg at rest
  2. Labile obstruction = outflow gradient of > 30 mmHg only with physiologic stimulation
  3. Nonobstructive = outflow gradient < 30 mmHg
- SAM mimics the clinical presentation of aortic stenosis
- SAM will often results in MV regurg and elevated left atrial pressures

## Adrenal Gland

| Tissue Area | Hormone Released | Example | Function |
| - | - | - | - |
| Zona glomerulosa | Mineralocorticoids | Aldosterone | Regulates mineral balance (Na retention)
| Zona fasciculata | Glucocorticoids | Cortisol, Cortisone | Regulates glucose metabolism |
| Zona reticularis | Androgens | Dehydroepiandrosterone | Stimulates masculinization |
| Adrenal medulla | Stress hormones | Epi, Norepi | Stimulates sympathetic ANS |
- Feedback loop:
   1. Hypothalamus --> CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone)
   2. Pituitary --> ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone)
   3. Adrenal cortex --> cortisol
- Addison's disease: 
  - primary adrenal insufficiency
  - both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid production is suppressed
- Secondary adrenal insufficiency:
  - only glucocorticoid production is suppressed
- Surgical administration of stress dose steroids is targeting secondary adrenal insufficiency
- Dexamethasone has only glucocorticoid activity with no mineralocorticoid activity

## Kussmaul Sign

- a significant increase in central pressure (as evidence by jugular venous distention) that occurs with inspiration

## Neonatal Jaundice

- Physiologic jaundice: transient increase in indirect bilirubin in first 12-48 hours after birth
- Pathologice jaundice: increase in total bilirubin (>12) and direct bilirubin (>2) within 36 hours and lasts beyond 10 days
- Breast milk jaundice: unclear etiology, occurs on day 4-7 after birth

## End Stage Liver Failure

- Symptoms:
  - hyperdynamic syndrome
  - high cardiac output
  - increased heart rate
  - increased total blood volume
  - reduced systemic vascular resistance
  - low or normal blood pressure
  - increased venous oxygen content
  - prolonged QT
- peripheral and splanchnic vasodilation is due to increased NO production in cirrhosis
- danger is undiagnosed cirrhotic cardiomyopathy - with stress comes increase in preload, leading to cardiac failure

## TIPS

- Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)
- Connects the vein which brings blood from your gastrointestinal tract and the vein from your liver to the right part of your heart
- Connects portal vein to hepatic vein to reduce flow to liver
  
## APGAR

- Appearance
- Pulse
- Grimace
- Activity
- Respiration

## Risks of Peripheral Nerve Injury

- male sex
- obesity

## Conditions that decrease nicotinic acetylcholine receptors

- myasthenia gravis
- anticholinesterase poisoning
- organophosphate poisoning

## Metformin

- Mechanism: reduction of gluconeogenesis, limiting the conversion of lactate and glycerol to glucose
- Side Effect: severe lactic acidosis
- hold while patient NPO
- treatment is withhold medication and hydrate

## Most common cause of pregnancy-related deaths?

- cardiovascular disease
- 1/3 of all deaths

## Magnesium

- mechanism: NMDA receptor blocker
- NMDA = N-methyl-D-aspartate
- When used:
  - preexlampsia
  - torsades de pointes (polymorphic V-tach)
  - pheochromocytoma
- Side effects:
  - hypotension
  - respiratory depression
  - muscle weakness
  - widened QRS duration
  - CNS toxicity

## Tocolytic Treatments

- tocolysis: labor suppression
- only safe for 48 hours of use (time for mom to receive steroids for neonatal lungs)
| Drug Class | Examples | Notes |
| - | - | - |
| Calcium channel blockers | Nifedipine | most commonly used, causes hypotention
| Cyclooxygenase inhibitors | Indomethacin, ketorolac | inhibits synthesis of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid
| Beta-adrenergic receptor agonist | Terbutaline | selective for B2, pulmonary edema most serious adverse effect
